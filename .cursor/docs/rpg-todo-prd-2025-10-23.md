    - Links to the terms of service and privacy policy will be included, opening in a new browser tab.
    - Task priority will be visually indicated using distinct colors: green for Low, yellow for Medium, orange for High, and red for Urgent.
    - Achievement progress will be displayed using progress bars or numerical values.
    - Notifications for achievement unlocks will be non-intrusive and provide positive reinforcement (e.g., a small toast notification).
